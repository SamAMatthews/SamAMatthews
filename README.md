# 'Sup, I'm Sam.

I am a passionate avgeek and tech nerd, and an active pilot in FlightGear, an open-source (and relatively obscure) flight simulator. I have also recently began some light developmental work on FlightGear, although I have made very little progress on it so far.

### Stuff

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  
  Currently I have a few projects in the works. I've been working on a stock market simulator in the form of a Discord bot for quite some time now, which, to say the least, has definitely proven to be quite the challenge. I also am working on an F-22 Raptor model for FlightGear, although I haven't made much progress on it yet.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  
  Python (still), XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  
  My F-22 Raptor project for FlightGear (although progress on it has been very marginal so far, in fact progress is almost zero).
  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
  
  Learning XML, Nasal, and probably a couple of other languages I haven't remembered, as well as help with all the many skills required in developing an aircraft for FlightGear, e.g. animation, FDMs, literally everything about FG aircraft development.
  
- 💬 Ask me about:
  
  Idk, I'm happy to (try to) help with any questions, queries, or concerns you may have, despite my limited programming knowledge :). I'm pretty sure I kinda know how to centre a div tho, if that's something you need help with for whatever reason.

- 📫 How to reach me:
  
  Chances are, you won't ever have any reason to need to communicate with me for any reason related to programming, but if you do, I'm active on FlightGear's Discord server as SamM#6386. My nickname there is VH-RM1 (which is also my callsign in FG), so if you're also a member there and at least occasionally use it (because I do check to make sure random accounts that try to reach out to me through mutual servers aren't bots), then I'm almost certain to respond. Alternatively, you can reach out directly to me in FlightGear, I almost always play on multiplayer with the callsign "VH-RM1" (as I said earlier). If you do this, I will almost certainly respond as soon as I can, although I would advise against talking to me during flight, otherwise I will probably end up landing so I can talk to you properly, and believe me when I say that I do not enjoy having to land just to talk to people.
