# 'Sup, I'm Sam.

I don't code very often, but when I do it's usually in Python.
I have a website. It's not very good, but it works well enough for me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  Currently I have a few projects in the works. I've been working on a stock market simulator in the form of a Discord bot for quite some time now, which, to say the least, has     definitely proven to be quite the challenge. I also am working on an F-22 Raptor model for FlightGear, an open-source flight simulator which I have spent quite a lot of time       using for fun, so I suppose it would be nice to return the favour and contribute something to the FG community.
 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  Python (still), XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  My F-22 Raptor project for FlightGear (although I have not yet created a repository or project for it)
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
  Learning XML, Nasal, and probably a couple of other languages I haven't remembered, as well as help with all the many skills required in developing an aircraft for FlightGear.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  Idk, I'm happy to (try to) help with any questions, queries, or concerns you may have, despite my limited programming knowledge :). I'm pretty sure I kinda know how to centre a   div tho, if that's something you need help with for whatever reason.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  Chances are, you won't ever have any reason to need to communicate with me for any reason related to programming, but if you do, I'm active on FlightGear's Discord server as       SamM#6386. My nickname there is VH-RM1 (which is also my callsign in FG), so if you're also a member there and at least occasionally use it (because I do check to make sure       random accounts that try to reach out to me through mutual servers aren't bots), then I'm almost certain to respond. Alternatively, you can reach out directly to me in             FlightGear, I almost always play on multiplayer with the callsign "VH-RM1" (as I said earlier). If you do this, I will almost certainly respond as soon as I can, although I would advise against talking to me during flight, otherwise I will probably have to land, and that would liely make me a little bit short-fused.
